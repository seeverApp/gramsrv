# gramsrv

`gramsrv` is an open-source Telegram-like MTProto server written in Go. It is
built for real client compatibility, self-hosted chat experiments, protocol
research, and long-running work toward a practical community server.

[Website](https://telesrv.net) · [Discussion group](https://t.me/telesrv_chat) · [Channel](https://t.me/telesrv) · [中文 README](README.zh-CN.md)

`gramsrv` is independent and unofficial. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
or sponsored by Telegram or the official Telegram team.

## Project Traits

| Status | Trait | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | One program startup | One Go binary prepares RSA keys, runs migrations, seeds data, opens MTProto, serves RPC handlers, dispatches updates, and starts workers. |
| ✅ | Fully open server code | Protocol edge, domain services, storage, compatibility handlers, media, updates, admin surfaces, and experiments are all in this repository. |

## Feature Checklist

Everything below is an implemented server-side capability in the open-source
codebase.

| Status | Feature | What works today |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | MTProto server edge | TCP transport, RSA key exchange, auth keys, encrypted sessions, salts, ack/resend, bad messages, RPC dispatch, and layer compatibility helpers. |
| ✅ | Login and accounts | Development login code, sign-in, sign-up, log-out, authorizations, account settings, SRP/password state, email/passkey-oriented paths. |
| ✅ | Users and contacts | User profiles, usernames, profile photos, contact import/search, blocked/privacy state, presence, and last-seen style status. |
| ✅ | Dialogs and sync | Dialog list, pinned dialogs, manual unread, folders/filters, drafts, read boundaries, durable updates, online fan-out, and offline difference recovery. |
| ✅ | Private chats | Send, history, read receipts, edit, delete, forward, reply, rich entities, grouped/media messages, reactions, scheduled/TTL-oriented paths. |
| ✅ | Supergroups and channels | Create, join, leave, invite links, participants, admins, forum topics, history, send/edit/delete/read, reactions, public search, and previews. |
| ✅ | Media and files | Upload, download, local blob storage, photos, documents, thumbnails, external media fetch, web page previews, map tile cache hooks, profile/channel photos. |
| ✅ | Stickers and reactions | Sticker/reaction catalog, seed support, recent reactions, top reactions, default reactions, and moderation-oriented reaction paths. |
| ✅ | Gifts and stars | Star gifts and local stars ledger foundations for compatibility and future feature work. |
| ✅ | Bots and mini apps | Bot service foundations, callbacks, inline helpers, webview/mini-app paths, minimal Bot API gateway, and demo tools. |
| ✅ | Calls and real-time | Private call signaling foundations, group call state, SFU/TURN building blocks, liveness, and expiry workers. |
| ✅ | Admin and operations | Admin API/UI backend, PostgreSQL migrations, Redis volatile state, retention workers, pprof/debug hooks, and load-test helpers. |
| ✅ | Desktop, Android, and Web focus | Telegram Desktop is the primary target, with Android and Web compatibility paths actively covered by the same server. |

Some items are compatibility-first or experimental, but they are real open
server code, not hidden product-only features. The next step is making these
paths stronger together.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Go 1.25 or newer
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Compose
- OpenSSL, if you want to build a matching Telegram Desktop client

Start PostgreSQL and Redis:

```powershell
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Build and run the single server program:

```powershell
go build -o bin/gramsrv.exe ./cmd/telesrv
.\bin\gramsrv.exe
```

On first start, `gramsrv` creates `data/server_rsa.pem`, applies database
migrations, seeds bundled language packs, prepares optional media resources,
starts MTProto on `0.0.0.0:2398`, and brings up the update/media/background
workers in the same process.

Useful local environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `TELESRV_LISTEN` | `0.0.0.0:2398` | MTProto listen address |
| `TELESRV_ADVERTISE_IP` | `127.0.0.1` | IP advertised to compatible clients |
| `TELESRV_DC` | `2` | self-hosted DC id |
| `TELESRV_DEV_AUTH_CODE` | `12345` | fixed login code for local development |
| `TELESRV_POSTGRES_DSN` | local Compose DSN | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `TELESRV_REDIS_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:6399` | Redis address |
| `TELESRV_LANGPACK_SEED_DIR` | `data/langpack` | bundled language pack seed directory |
| `TELESRV_BLOB_DIR` | `data/blobs` | local media blob directory |
| `TELESRV_STICKER_SEED_DIR` | `data/sticker-seed` | optional sticker/reaction seed directory |

The optional sticker seed directory is skipped when it does not exist.

## Client Compatibility

Stock Telegram clients will not connect to `gramsrv` because they trust
Telegram's production DC list and RSA keys. Use a patched experience client from
the [official website](https://telesrv.net), or build your own client with a
minimal protocol patch.

Current Telegram Desktop baseline:

- Telegram Desktop commit: `9caf32dffc90ddd9bb08ad5777b865f729fa167b`
- TL layer: 225
- Local DC: `127.0.0.1:2398`, DC id `2`

After `gramsrv` generates `data/server_rsa.pem`, export the matching public key:

```powershell
openssl rsa -in data/server_rsa.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -out data/server_rsa.pub
```

Patch `Telegram/SourceFiles/mtproto/mtproto_dc_options.cpp`:

1. Replace the built-in production/test DC lists with your `gramsrv` endpoint.
2. Replace both `kPublicRSAKeys` and `kTestPublicRSAKeys` with
   `data/server_rsa.pub`.
3. Add `Flag::f_tcpo_only` to the built-in DC flags.

Keep the client patch minimal: endpoint, RSA key, and TCP-only flags only.

## Multi-Device Smoke Test

Use separate client working directories so sessions do not share local `tdata`:

```powershell
$tdesktop = "C:\path\to\tdesktop\out\Debug\Telegram.exe"
Start-Process $tdesktop -ArgumentList @("-workdir", "$PWD\.tdata-alice")
Start-Process $tdesktop -ArgumentList @("-workdir", "$PWD\.tdata-bob")
```

Log in with different phone numbers. In local development, the login code is
`12345` unless you changed `TELESRV_DEV_AUTH_CODE`.

Recommended checks:

- Send private messages, stickers, media, replies, forwards, edits, deletes,
  and read receipts between two users.
- Keep one device online and restart another device to verify offline
  `updates.getDifference` recovery.
- Open the same account from multiple sessions and confirm current-session
  echoes are not duplicated while other online sessions receive updates.
- Check server logs for no new `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `Unhandled RPC`, `bad_msg`,
  panic, or internal errors.

## Help Improve It

`gramsrv` will get better fastest if more people run it, break it, profile it,
and send focused improvements. Helpful contributions include:

- Telegram Desktop and Android compatibility reports with reproducible steps.
- RPC traces for startup, sync, chat, media, calls, bots, or edge cases.
- Focused fixes for implemented paths instead of broad rewrites.
- Tests for online/offline updates, multi-device sessions, read state, media,
  and channel behavior.
- Performance work on hot paths such as fan-out, pagination, storage queries,
  media upload/download, and connection handling.
- Setup improvements that make the one-program local experience smoother.

If a change affects visible client behavior, please include the client
version/commit, the RPC path you tested, and whether server logs stayed free of
new `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `Unhandled RPC`, `bad_msg`, panic, or internal errors.
